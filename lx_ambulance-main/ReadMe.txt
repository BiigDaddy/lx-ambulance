lx_ambulance - an edited version of one of the many esx_ambulancejob forks. Credit to the creators of that script.

PLEASE NOTE - THE STANDARD TRIGGERS ARE EDITED DUE TO MY ANTICHEAT, YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE SOME OF THE TRIGGERS LIKE GETSHAREDOBJECT, the added text in these triggers will be 'lxg' 

This is an edit we had done for our server by someone, unfortunatley it has a slight bug, where every now and then a player may spawn into the server already dead, this does not happen all the time.
Other then this the resource is fully functionging, with persistent deaths , meaning if a player relogs while dead, they will still be dead when they rejoin, aswell as an option for ems to send players to 'ICU' pretty much a 5 minute punishment where they can rethink there life choices and learn to value there life.

Please, as i was decent enough to to release this publicly, make a pull request or send the code to me on github, for me to update :) this way all of the community can enjoy this edit, fully working :) 

NOTE - THIS SCRIPT IS INTENDED TO RUN ALONGSIDE THE 'mythic_hospital' SCRIPT, INSIDE THE DOWNLOAD.
